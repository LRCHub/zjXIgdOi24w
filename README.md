[00:27.66] I'm waking from this dream
[00:33.26] [00:33.26] Returning to reality is so bittersweet
[00:43.61] [00:43.61] But I open my eyes and the illusion is fading
[00:54.67] [00:54.67] Slipping away
[01:02.22] [01:02.22] It was just within reach, yet so far
[01:15.89] [01:15.89] I lay here all alone once more
[01:30.53] [01:30.53] I dreamed you were beside me
[01:34.22] [01:34.22] You were there once again, as if you had never left and
[01:42.27] [01:42.27] I remember wanting to say, asking you not to go
[01:50.19] [01:50.19] But I know that was impossible then
[02:00.40] [02:00.40] You say, "I can't stay here" as my damp eyes open
[02:24.51] [02:24.51] The sunshine's on the bleak horizon
[02:31.72] [02:31.72] It's just another day
[02:35.63] [02:35.63] I look out at dimly lit buildings and I think of you
[02:46.30] [02:46.30] Am I imagining, you here, right next to me?
[02:53.49] [02:53.49] Your eyes catch my own
[02:58.26] [02:58.26] I look back fleetingly before I realize you're really there
[03:11.06] [03:11.06] I dreamed you'd be beside me, that we will meet again
[03:18.14] [03:18.14] Your eyes glistened, your tears are falling
[03:22.71] [03:22.71] I know you have not forgotten the last time we shared
[03:29.87] [03:29.87] As I quietly watch you wipe your tears away
[03:40.31] [03:40.31] Although I've found you, I know this meeting will not last
[03:47.72] [03:47.72] I have to let go, continue finding a way
[03:53.74] [03:53.74] Though I will miss you
[03:57.84] [03:57.84] It's time to wake from this dream
[04:02.84] [04:06.51]
